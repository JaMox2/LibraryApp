# How It's Made:
First thing I did was I made a Book object factory that I can call for whenever I need a new book object to be created. After that I created a Library class with constructor of doms, IN then created a method that allows me to press the add book button that than displays the Add Book UI. With that I created a UI that allows me to input the title, author, page number, and whether or not I have read the book. With this, once the submit button is click it than calls for another method which adds the book object into an array that I used to get the title to check if the book is already there. If it is there do not add it and if not do add it. Last thing I did was make the dom show it with some dom manipulation.

#Lessons Learned:
- Allowed me to practice DOM manipulation
- Tried using OOP 
- How to use methods inside of methods
- Getting use to having as little code outside objects or class

#Add Ons
- Add a login function
- Maybe add a search function
- Add a localStorage function
